NBLINK: (0), (1)

- rating:
formatted as an (x, x+1] string
modified as x+1 integer
NBLINK: (2)

- rating count ambiguity:
the following data seems ambiguous:
    numVotes: Number of votes the title has received.
    criticReviewsTotal: Total Number of Critic Reviews.
    ratingCount: The total number of user ratings submitted for the title.
    userReviewsTotal: Total Number of Users Reviews.
1 - no correlation between (userReviewsTotal, criticReviewsTotal) and (ratingCount, numVotes)
TODO(?) show no correlation
2 - numVotes and ratingCount are very similar:
but it's intresting to notice that there are outliers
the mean of the difference between the two fields is 0.75, but
the higher value is 318
NBLINK: (3)
a plot of the distribution of these (possibly) outliers
LINK:   difference_between_numVotes_ratingCount_dirt.png
NBLINK: (4)
to answer the question if these values are outliers or to be fixed
lets see how many of them are over 10 entries
LINK:   high_difference_numVotes_ratingCount.xlsx
NBLINK: (5)
so lets check the magnitudo of the difference with respect of the
two values from which it originates
to check te magnitudo let's take the difference and divide it by
the mean between numVotes and ratingCount
this requires the mean to be non zero, hence entries having
bot numVotes and ratingCount as zero are dropped
(if the entries had zero, it would clearly be a wrong data)
NBLINK: (7)
and then compute the magnitudo
we can clearly see the maximum magnitudo being 0.1538
which means the difference is not in the same order of magnitude
as the values that generates it
NBLINK: (6)
